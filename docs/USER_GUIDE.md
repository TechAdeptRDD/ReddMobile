# 📖 ReddMobile User Guide

## 🔐 The Secure Vault
Upon opening the app, you are greeted by the **Secure Vault**. 
* Click **Unlock Wallet** to enter the Dashboard. 
* *Note: In future versions, this will be protected by your phone's Biometrics or a PIN.*

Your Dashboard displays your current Reddcoin activity.
* **Recent Activity:** Scroll through your transaction history. 
* **Status Indicators:** Transactions marked "Pending" are awaiting network confirmations.

## 💸 Sending Reddcoin

2.  Enter the recipient's **Reddcoin Address**.
3.  Enter the **Amount** in RDD.
4.  Tap **Confirm & Send**.

## 🆔 ReddID (Beta)
ReddMobile allows you to interact with the ReddID system. Use the search functions to find handles and prepare "bids" to claim your social identity on the blockchain.

## 🛡️ Best Practices
* **Keep your App Updated:** Always check the "Releases" tab on GitHub for the latest `.apk`.
* **Testing:** If using a cloud emulator like Appetize.io, ensure you are running build `v0.1.3` or higher.
