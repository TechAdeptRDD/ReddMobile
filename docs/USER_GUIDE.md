# ReddMobile: User Guide

Welcome to the future of social currency. ReddMobile is designed to make Reddcoin (RDD) and ReddID as accessible as your favorite social media app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. The Dashboard
Your Dashboard is your command center. From here, you can:
* **Check Balance:** View your current RDD holdings in real-time.
* **Search ReddID:** Type in a handle (e.g., `techadept`) to see if it is available for registration.
* **Activity Feed:** See a live-synced history of your incoming and outgoing transactions.

### 2. Acquiring a ReddID
To register your unique identity on the blockchain:
1. Use the search bar to find an available handle.
2. If available, click **"Bid"**.
3. Confirm the transaction. This will create a specialized `OP_RETURN` transaction on the Reddcoin network, linking your address to that handle.

### 3. Sending RDD
1. Tap the **Send** icon (Paper Plane) in the top right.
2. Enter the recipient's Reddcoin address.
3. Enter the amount.
4. Confirm. The app will automatically calculate the network fee and combine your available coins to complete the transfer.

## 🛡️ Security
* **Vault:** Your private keys never leave your phone. They are stored in an encrypted vault managed by a high-security Rust engine.
* **Biometrics:** (Coming Soon) You can unlock your wallet using FaceID or Fingerprint.
