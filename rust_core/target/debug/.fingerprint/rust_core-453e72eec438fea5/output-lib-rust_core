{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"the trait bound `bitcoin::secp256k1::PublicKey: From<secp256k1::PublicKey>` is not satisfied","code":{"code":"E0277","explanation":"You tried to use a type which doesn't implement some trait in a place which\nexpected that trait.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\n// here we declare the Foo trait with a bar method\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we now declare a function which takes an object implementing the Foo trait\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // we now call the method with the i32 type, which doesn't implement\n    // the Foo trait\n    some_func(5i32); // error: the trait bound `i32 : Foo` is not satisfied\n}\n```\n\nIn order to fix this error, verify that the type you're using does implement\nthe trait. Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/transaction_signer.rs","byte_start":3386,"byte_end":3396,"line_start":76,"line_end":76,"column_start":48,"column_end":58,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"

{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"the trait bound `&secp256k1::Message: Into<secp256k1::Message>` is not satisfied","code":{"code":"E0277","explanation":"You tried to use a type which doesn't implement some trait in a place which\nexpected that trait.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\n// here we declare the Foo trait with a bar method\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we now declare a function which takes an object implementing the Foo trait\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // we now call the method with the i32 type, which doesn't implement\n    // the Foo trait\n    some_func(5i32); // error: the trait bound `i32 : Foo` is not satisfied\n}\n```\n\nIn order to fix this error, verify that the type you're using does implement\nthe trait. Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/transaction_signer.rs","byte_start":7608,"byte_end":7616,"line_start":160,"line_end":160,"column_start":43,"column_end":51,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    let ecdsa_signature = secp.sign_ecdsa(&message, &secret_key);","highlight_start":43,"highlight_end":51}],"label":"the trait `secp256k1::ThirtyTwoByteHash` is not implemented for `&secp256k1::Message`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"src/transaction_signer.rs","byte_start":7597,"byte_end":7607,"line_start":160,"line_end":160,"column_start":32,"column_end":42,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"    let ecdsa_signature = secp.sign_ecdsa(&message, &secret_key);","highlight_start":32,"highlight_end":42}],"label":"required by a bound introduced by this call","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"there are multiple different versions of crate `secp256k1` in the dependency graph","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/codespace/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/secp256k1-0.31.1/src/lib.rs","byte_start":8515,"byte_end":8542,"line_start":208,"line_end":208,"column_start":1,"column_end":28,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub trait ThirtyTwoByteHash {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":28}],"label":"this is the expected trait","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"/home/codespace/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/secp256k1-0.29.1/src/lib.rs","byte_start":8698,"byte_end":8725,"line_start":209,"line_end":209,"column_start":1,"column_end":28,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"pub trait ThirtyTwoByteHash {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":28}],"label":"this is the trait that was imported","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"you can use `cargo tree` to explore your dependency tree","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"item with same name found","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"/home/codespace/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/secp256k1-0.29.1/src/lib.rs","byte_start":8927,"byte_end":8945,"line_start":216,"line_end":216,"column_start":1,"column_end":19,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub struct Message([u8;
