# ReddMobile Monorepo

This repository is organized into three primary workspaces:

- `app/` — Flutter frontend application and Isar database integration.
- `core/` — Rust cryptography primitives, BIP39 support, and vault encryption logic.
- `api/` — Dart API client configured for `https://blockbook.reddcoin.com/api/v2/`.
